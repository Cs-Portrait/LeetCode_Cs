## 189. Rotate Array

Rotate an array of *n* elements to the right by *k* steps.

For example, with *n* = 7 and *k* = 3, the array `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]` is rotated to `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`.

**Note:**
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

思路一：

```c++
class Solution {
public:
	void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
		size_t n = k % nums.size();
		if (n == 0)
		{	// When n is zero, It means that k is zero or a multiple of nums.size()
			// So we have nothing to do
			return;
		}
		size_t i = 0;
		vector<bool> isViewed(nums.size(), false);
		while (!isViewed[i])
		{
			size_t p = (i + n) % nums.size();
			int preVal = nums[i];
			while (p != i)
			{
				int tmp = nums[p];
				nums[p] = preVal;
				isViewed[p] = true;
				preVal = tmp;
				p = (p+n) % nums.size();
			}
			nums[i] = preVal;
			isViewed[i] = true;
			++i;
		}
	}
};
