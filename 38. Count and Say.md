## 38. Count and Say

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers beginning as follows:
`1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, ...`

`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n*, generate the $n^{th}$ sequence.

Note: The sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

思路一：

首先计算有多少个`1`或`2`，接着添加到`tmp`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
	string countAndSay(int n) {
		string s = "1";
		if (n < 2)
		{
			return s;
		}
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
		{
			string tmp;
			size_t j = 1;
			auto c = s[0];
			int count = 1;
			while (j < s.size())
			{
				if (c == s[j])
				{
					count++;
				}
				else
				{
					tmp += to_string(count) + c;
					c = s[j];
					count = 1;
				}
				j++;
			}
			tmp += to_string(count) + c;
			s = tmp;
		}
		return s;
	}
};
```
